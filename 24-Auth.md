## What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)? 

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

## EXAMPLES OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL


Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

1- Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.

2- Management role group – you can add and remove members.

3- Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.

4- Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.
