# Redux Asynchronous Actions


the React-Redux library to let our React components interact with a Redux store, including calling useSelector to read Redux state, calling useDispatch to give us access to the dispatch function, and wrapping our app in a `<Provider>` component to give those hooks access to the store.

So far, all the data we've worked with has been directly inside of our React+Redux client application. However, most real applications need to work with data from a server, by making HTTP API calls to fetch and save items.

In this section, we'll update our todo app to fetch the todos from an API, and add new todos by saving them to the API.



## Example REST API and Client

To keep the example project isolated but realistic, the initial project setup already included a fake in-memory REST API for our data (configured using the Mirage.js mock API tool). The API uses /fakeApi as the base URL for the endpoints, and supports the typical GET/POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP methods for /fakeApi/todos. It's defined in src/api/server.js.

The project also includes a small HTTP API client object that exposes client.get() and client.post() methods, similar to popular HTTP libraries like axios. It's defined in src/api/client.js.

We'll use the client object to make HTTP calls to our in-memory fake REST API for this section.


we said that Redux reducers must never contain "side effects". A "side effect" is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function. Some common kinds of side effects are things like:

- Logging a value to the console
- Saving a file
- Setting an async timer
- Making an AJAX HTTP request
- Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
- Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now()).




# Redux Async Data Flow

So how do middleware and async logic affect the overall data flow of a Redux app?

Just like with a normal action, we first need to handle a user event in the application, such as a click on a button. Then, we call dispatch(), and pass in something, whether it be a plain action object, a function, or some other value that a middleware can look for.

Once that dispatched value reaches a middleware, it can make an async call, and then dispatch a real action object when the async call completes.

Earlier, we saw a diagram that represents the normal synchronous Redux data flow. When we add async logic to a Redux app, we add an extra step where middleware can run logic like AJAX requests, then dispatch actions. That makes the async data flow look like this:
