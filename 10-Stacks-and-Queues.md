# Stacks and Queues


## What is a Stack
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common terminology for a stack is

1- ***Push*** - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.

2- ***Pop*** - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

3- ***Top*** - This is the top of the stack.

4- ***Peek*** - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

5- ***IsEmpty*** - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

Stacks follow these concepts:

**FILO**

***First In Last Out***


***LIFO***

***Last In First Out***
