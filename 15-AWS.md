# AWS 

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

AWS launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that scales to provide users with compute, storage or throughput as needed.

AWS offers many different tools and solutions for enterprises and software developers that can be used in data centers in up to 190 countries. Groups such as government agencies, education institutions, nonprofits and private organizations can use AWS services.

The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Connect, and AWS Lambda (a serverless function enabling serverless ETL e.g. between instances of EC2 & S3). Most services are not exposed directly to end users, but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications.

In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers. 

Market leadership (2016–present) [ edit ] James Hamilton, who leads AWS' compute, data center, and network design, wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016.

On December 24, 2012, AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the  NortheasternUnited States. 

AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing service as the cause. 

No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage.

# AWS Elastic Beanstalk


AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.

There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.


## Benefits

### ***Fast and simple to begin***

Elastic Beanstalk is the fastest and simplest way to deploy your application on AWS. You simply use the AWS Management Console, a Git repository, or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or Visual Studio to upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. Within minutes, your application will be ready to use without any infrastructure or resource configuration work on your part.

### ***Developer productivity***

Elastic Beanstalk provisions and operates the infrastructure and manages the application stack (platform) for you, so you don't have to spend the time or develop the expertise. It will also keep the underlying platform running your application up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. Instead, you can focus on writing code rather than spending time managing and configuring servers, databases, load balancers, firewalls, and networks.

### ***Impossible to outgrow***

Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales your application up and down based on your application's specific need using easily adjustable Auto Scaling settings. For example, you can use CPU utilization metrics to trigger Auto Scaling actions. With Elastic Beanstalk, your application can handle peaks in workload or traffic while minimizing your costs.

### ***Complete resource control***

You have the freedom to select the AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instance type and processor type to run the workload on, that are optimal for your application. You also retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application. If you decide you want to take over some (or all) of the elements of your infrastructure, you can do so seamlessly by using Elastic Beanstalk's management capabilities.
