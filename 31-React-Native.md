React Native (also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.

Many different kinds of people use React Native: from advanced iOS developers to React beginners, to people getting started programming for the first time in their career. These docs were written for all learners, no matter their experience level or background.

## How to use these docs

You can start here and read through these docs linearly like a book; or you can read the specific sections you need. Already familiar with React? You can skip that section—or read it for a light refresher.

## What is React Native used for?

React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Use a little—or a lot. You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app from scratch.
